                    Indian breakfast is a vibrant reflection of the country's diverse culinary traditions. In South India, dishes like idli
                    and dosa made from fermented rice and lentils are popular, often served with coconut chutney and sambar. North India
                    favors parathas stuffed with potatoes or paneer, paired with yogurt and pickles. In the West, dishes like poha and upma
                    are common, while street food options like vada pav and bhaji highlight the region's flavors. Breakfast is not just a

                    unique offerings showcase India's rich gastronomic heritage.
